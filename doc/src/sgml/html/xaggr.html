>   Aggregate functions in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
   are defined in terms of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>state values</I

   and <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>state transition functions</I
>.
   That is, an aggregate operates using a state value that is updated
   as each successive input row is processed.
   To define a new aggregate
   function, one selects a data type for the state value,
   an initial value for the state, and a state transition
   function.  The state transition function takes the previous state
   value and the aggregate's input value(s) for the current row, and
   returns a new state value.
   A <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>final function</I
>
   can also be specified, in case the desired result of the aggregate
   is different from the data that needs to be kept in the running
   state value.  The final function takes the ending state value
   and returns whatever is wanted as the aggregate result.
   In principle, the transition and final functions are just ordinary
   functions that could also be used outside the context of the
   aggregate.  (In practice, it's often helpful for performance reasons
   to create specialized transition functions that can only work when
   called as part of an aggregate.)
  </P
><P
>   Thus, in addition to the argument and result data types seen by a user
   of the aggregate, there is an internal state-value data type that
   might be different from both the argument and result types.
  </P
><P
>   If we define an aggregate that does not use a final function,
   we have an aggregate that computes a running function of
   the column values from each row.  <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sum</CODE
>  is  an
   example  of  this  kind  of aggregate.  <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sum</CODE

   zero and always adds the current  row's  value  to
   its  running  total.  For example, if we want to make a <CODE

   aggregate to work on a data type for complex numbers,
   we only need the addition function for that data type.
   The aggregate definition would be:

</P><PRE

    sfunc = complex_add,

   which we might use like this:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

   sum

   (Notice that we are relying on function overloading: there is more than
    one aggregate named <CODE

  </P

   Perhaps we want to return null in that case instead &mdash; the SQL standard
   expects <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sum</CODE

   omitting the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   value is null.  Ordinarily this would mean that the <TT

   would need to check for a null state-value input.  But for
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sum</CODE

   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

CLASS="FUNCTION"

   it is sufficient to insert the first nonnull input value into
   the state variable and then start applying the transition function
   at the second nonnull input value.  <SPAN

   will do that automatically if the initial state value is null and
   the transition function is marked <SPAN

  </P
><P
>   Another bit of default behavior for a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"strict"</SPAN

   is that the previous state value is retained unchanged whenever a
   null input value is encountered.  Thus, null values are ignored.  If you
   need some other behavior for null inputs, do not declare your
   transition function as strict; instead code it to test for null inputs and
   do whatever is needed.

   It requires
   two pieces of running state: the sum of the inputs and the count
   of the number of inputs.  The final result is obtained by dividing
   these quantities.  Average is typically implemented by using an
   array as the state value.  For example,
   the built-in implementation of <CODE

   functions within windows with moving frame starting points.
   (See <A

   and <A
HREF="sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-WINDOW-FUNCTIONS"

   The basic idea is that in addition to a normal <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   transition function, the aggregate provides an <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>inverse
   transition function</I
>, which allows rows to be removed from the
   aggregate's running state value when they exit the window frame.
   For example a <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sum</CODE
> aggregate, which uses addition as the
   forward transition function, would use subtraction as the inverse
   transition function.  Without an inverse transition function, the window
   function mechanism must recalculate the aggregate from scratch each time
   the frame starting point moves, resulting in run time proportional to the
   number of input rows times the average frame length.  With an inverse
   transition function, the run time is only proportional to the number of
   input rows.
  </P
><P
>   The inverse transition function is passed the current state value and the
   aggregate input value(s) for the earliest row included in the current
   state.  It must reconstruct what the state value would have been if the
   given input row had never been aggregated, but only the rows following
   it.  This sometimes requires that the forward transition function keep
   more state than is needed for plain aggregation mode.  Therefore, the
   moving-aggregate mode uses a completely separate implementation from the
   plain mode: it has its own state data type, its own forward transition
   function, and its own final function if needed.  These can be the same as
   the plain mode's data type and functions, if there is no need for extra
   state.
  </P
><P
>   As an example, we could extend the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

   to support moving-aggregate mode like this:

   parameters without <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>m</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   The forward transition function for moving-aggregate mode is not allowed
   to return null as the new state value.  If the inverse transition
   function returns null, this is taken as an indication that the inverse
   function cannot reverse the state calculation for this particular input,
   and so the aggregate calculation will be redone from scratch for the
   current frame starting position.  This convention allows moving-aggregate
   mode to be used in situations where there are some infrequent cases that
   are impractical to reverse out of the running state value.  The inverse
   transition function can <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"punt"</SPAN
> on these cases, and yet still come
   out ahead so long as it can work for most cases.  As an example, an
   aggregate working with floating-point numbers might choose to punt when
   a <TT

>NaN</TT
> (not a number) input has to be removed from the running
   state value.
  </P
><P
>   When writing moving-aggregate support functions, it is important to be
   sure that the inverse transition function can reconstruct the correct
   state value exactly.  Otherwise there might be user-visible differences
   in results depending on whether the moving-aggregate mode is used.
   An example of an aggregate for which adding an inverse transition
   function seems easy at first, yet where this requirement cannot be met
   is <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>sum</CODE

CLASS="TYPE"
>float4</TT

   This aggregate, however, can give wildly different results than it would
   have without the inverse transition function. For example, consider

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

  unsafe_sum(x) OVER (ORDER BY n ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 1 FOLLOWING)

   This query returns <TT

   Going a step further, the aggregate function itself can be specified
   with polymorphic input type(s) and state type, allowing a single

   is to concatenate all the inputs into an array of that type.
   (Note: the built-in aggregate <CODE

>   Ordinarily, an aggregate function with a polymorphic result type has a
   polymorphic state type, as in the above example.  This is necessary
   because otherwise the final function cannot be declared sensibly: it
   would need to have a polymorphic result type but no polymorphic argument
   type, which <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE FUNCTION</TT
> will reject on the grounds that
   the result type cannot be deduced from a call.  But sometimes it is
   inconvenient to use a polymorphic state type.  The most common case is
   where the aggregate support functions are to be written in C and the
   state type should be declared as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>internal</TT
> because there is
   no SQL-level equivalent for it.  To address this case, it is possible to
   declare the final function as taking extra <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dummy"</SPAN
> arguments
   that match the input arguments of the aggregate.  Such dummy arguments
   are always passed as null values since no specific value is available when the
   final function is called.  Their only use is to allow a polymorphic
   final function's result type to be connected to the aggregate's input
   type(s).  For example, the definition of the built-in
   aggregate <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>array_agg</CODE
> is equivalent to

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION array_agg_transfn(internal, anynonarray)

    sfunc = array_agg_transfn,
    stype = internal,
    finalfunc = array_agg_finalfn,
    finalfunc_extra
);</PRE
><P>

   Here, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>finalfunc_extra</TT
> option specifies that the final
   function receives, in addition to the state value, extra dummy
   argument(s) corresponding to the aggregate's input argument(s).
   The extra <TT

   of <CODE

   aggregate's state type (representing the results of aggregating over two
   subsets of the input rows) and produces a new value of the state type,
   representing what the state would have been after aggregating over the
   combination of those sets of rows.  It is unspecified what the relative
   order of the input rows from the two sets would have been.  This means
   that it's usually impossible to define a useful combine function for
   aggregates that are sensitive to input row order.

CLASS="LITERAL"

   made to support partial aggregation by specifying the combine function as
   the same greater-of-two or lesser-of-two comparison function that is used
   as their transition function.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

> aggregates just need an
   addition function as combine function.  (Again, this is the same as their
   transition function, unless the state value is wider than the input data
   type.)
  </P
><P
>   The combine function is treated much like a transition function that
   happens to take a value of the state type, not of the underlying input
   type, as its second argument.  In particular, the rules for dealing
   with null values and strict functions are similar.  Also, if the aggregate
   definition specifies a non-null <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>initcond</TT
>, keep in mind that
   that will be used not only as the initial state for each partial
   aggregation run, but also as the initial state for the combine function,
   which will be called to combine each partial result into that state.
  </P
><P
>   If the aggregate's state type is declared as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>internal</TT
>, it is
   the combine function's responsibility that its result is allocated in
   the correct memory context for aggregate state values.  This means in
   particular that when the first input is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> it's invalid
   to simply return the second input, as that value will be in the wrong
   context and will not have sufficient lifespan.
  </P
><P
>   When the aggregate's state type is declared as <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>internal</TT
>, it is
   usually also appropriate for the aggregate definition to provide a
   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>serialization function</I
> and a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>deserialization
   function</I
>, which allow such a state value to be copied from one process
   to another.  Without these functions, parallel aggregation cannot be
   performed, and future applications such as local/remote aggregation will
   probably not work either.
  </P
><P
>   A serialization function must take a single argument of
   type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>internal</TT
> and return a result of type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bytea</TT
>, which
   represents the state value packaged up into a flat blob of bytes.
   Conversely, a deserialization function reverses that conversion.  It must
   take two arguments of types <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bytea</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>internal</TT
>, and
   return a result of type <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>internal</TT
>.  (The second argument is unused
   and is always zero, but it is required for type-safety reasons.)  The
   result of the deserialization function should simply be allocated in the
   current memory context, as unlike the combine function's result, it is not
   long-lived.
  </P
><P
>   Worth noting also is that for an aggregate to be executed in parallel,
   the aggregate itself must be marked <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PARALLEL SAFE</TT

   parallel-safety markings on its support functions are not consulted.

><P
>   A function written in C can detect that it is being called as an
   aggregate support function by calling
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AggCheckCallContext</CODE
>, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>if (AggCheckCallContext(fcinfo, NULL))</PRE
><P>
   One reason for checking this is that when it is true for a transition
   function, the first input
   must be a temporary state value and can therefore safely be modified
   in-place rather than allocating a new copy.
   See <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>int8inc()</CODE
> for an example.
   (This is the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>only</I
></SPAN
>
   case where it is safe for a function to modify a pass-by-reference input.
   In particular, final functions for normal aggregates must not
   modify their inputs in any case, because in some cases they will be
   re-executed on the same final state value.)
  </P
><P
>   The second argument of <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AggCheckCallContext</CODE
> can be used to
   retrieve the memory context in which aggregate state values are being kept.
   This is useful for transition functions that wish to use <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"expanded"</SPAN
>
   objects (see <A
HREF="xtypes.html#XTYPES-TOAST"
>Section 36.11.1</A
>) as their state values.
   On first call, the transition function should return an expanded object
   whose memory context is a child of the aggregate state context, and then
   keep returning the same expanded object on subsequent calls.  See
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>array_append()</CODE
> for an example.  (<CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>array_append()</CODE

   is not the transition function of any built-in aggregate, but it is written
   to behave efficiently when used as transition function of a custom
   aggregate.)
  </P
><P
>   Another support routine available to aggregate functions written in C
   is <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AggGetAggref</CODE
>, which returns the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Aggref</TT
>
   parse node that defines the aggregate call.  This is mainly useful
   for ordered-set aggregates, which can inspect the substructure of
   the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Aggref</TT
> node to find out what sort ordering they are
   supposed to implement.  Examples can be found
   in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>orderedsetaggs.c</TT
