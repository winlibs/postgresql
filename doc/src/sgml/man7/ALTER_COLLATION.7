.SH "NAME"
ALTER_COLLATION \- change the definition of a collation
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
ALTER COLLATION \fIname\fR REFRESH VERSION

ALTER COLLATION \fIname\fR RENAME TO \fInew_name\fR
ALTER COLLATION \fIname\fR OWNER TO { \fInew_owner\fR | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER COLLATION \fIname\fR SET SCHEMA \fInew_schema\fR
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER COLLATION\fR
changes the definition of a collation\&.
.PP
You must own the collation to use
\fBALTER COLLATION\fR\&. To alter the owner, you must be able to
SET ROLE
to the new owning role, and that role must have
CREATE
privilege on the collation\*(Aqs schema\&. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn\*(Aqt do anything you couldn\*(Aqt do by dropping and recreating the collation\&. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any collation anyway\&.)
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIname\fR
.RS 4
The name (optionally schema\-qualified) of an existing collation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fInew_name\fR
.RS 4
The new name of the collation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fInew_owner\fR
.RS 4
The new owner of the collation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fInew_schema\fR
.RS 4
The new schema for the collation\&.
.RE
.PP
REFRESH VERSION
.RS 4
Update the collation\*(Aqs version\&. See
Notes
below\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
When a collation object is created, the provider\-specific version of the collation is recorded in the system catalog\&. When the collation is used, the current version is checked against the recorded version, and a warning is issued when there is a mismatch, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
WARNING:  collation "xx\-x\-icu" has version mismatch
DETAIL:  The collation in the database was created using version 1\&.2\&.3\&.4, but the operating system provides version 2\&.3\&.4\&.5\&.
HINT:  Rebuild all objects affected by this collation and run ALTER COLLATION pg_catalog\&."xx\-x\-icu" REFRESH VERSION, or build PostgreSQL with the right library version\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A change in collation definitions can lead to corrupt indexes and other problems because the database system relies on stored objects having a certain sort order\&. Generally, this should be avoided, but it can happen in legitimate circumstances, such as when upgrading the operating system to a new major version or when using
\fBpg_upgrade\fR
to upgrade to server binaries linked with a newer version of ICU\&. When this happens, all objects depending on the collation should be rebuilt, for example, using
\fBREINDEX\fR\&. When that is done, the collation version can be refreshed using the command
ALTER COLLATION \&.\&.\&. REFRESH VERSION\&. This will update the system catalog to record the current collation version and will make the warning go away\&. Note that this does not actually check whether all affected objects have been rebuilt correctly\&.
.PP
When using collations provided by
libc, version information is recorded on systems using the GNU C library (most Linux systems), FreeBSD and Windows\&. When using collations provided by ICU, the version information is provided by the ICU library and is available on all platforms\&.

\fBNote\fR
.ps -1

.PP
When using the GNU C library for collations, the C library\*(Aqs version is used as a proxy for the collation version\&. Many Linux distributions change collation definitions only when upgrading the C library, but this approach is imperfect as maintainers are free to back\-port newer collation definitions to older C library releases\&.
.PP
When using Windows for collations, version information is only available for collations defined with BCP 47 language tags such as
en\-US\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
For the database default collation, there is an analogous command
ALTER DATABASE \&.\&.\&. REFRESH COLLATION VERSION\&.
.PP
The following query can be used to identify all collations in the current database that need to be refreshed and the objects that depend on them:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SELECT pg_describe_object(refclassid, refobjid, refobjsubid) AS "Collation",
       pg_describe_object(classid, objid, objsubid) AS "Object"
  FROM pg_depend d JOIN pg_collation c
       ON refclassid = \*(Aqpg_collation\*(Aq::regclass AND refobjid = c\&.oid
  WHERE c\&.collversion <> pg_collation_actual_version(c\&.oid)
  ORDER BY 1, 2;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To rename the collation
de_DE
to
german:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ALTER COLLATION "de_DE" RENAME TO german;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To change the owner of the collation
en_US
to
joe:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ALTER COLLATION "en_US" OWNER TO joe;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
There is no
\fBALTER COLLATION\fR
statement in the SQL standard\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
CREATE COLLATION (\fBCREATE_COLLATION\fR(7)), DROP COLLATION (\fBDROP_COLLATION\fR(7))
